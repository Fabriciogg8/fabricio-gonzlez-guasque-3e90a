**English.** in dicember of 2020 I aprobed the First Certificate in English.

Since I was a kid I began to watch movies and series in english. That gave me the opportunity to start hearing this language, and learn more about it.

Also in 2012 I had the opportunity to travel to New Zealand and Australia for 30 days, where I was able to interact with the citizens
