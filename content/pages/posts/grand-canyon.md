**Sembrando TIC.**  In March 2021 I applied for a scholarship in the Sembrando TIC program.

• Generate technological solutions for micro-enterprises
• Develop online technologies for products and services
• Implement basic functionalities in programming language that a micro-enterprise requires
• Extract and analyze data used for business planning
• Create and manage tools for the dissemination of results and product marketing.
