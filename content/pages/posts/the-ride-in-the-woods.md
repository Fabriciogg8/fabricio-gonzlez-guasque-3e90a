# **HTML, CSS, JS**

As a part of the knowledge requirements in the program of Sembrando TIC, I have been studying this technologies.

## HTML

I have been used to managing the different labels, and understanding for what they are for. Knowing the difference of container labels and content labels.

## css

I'm using CSS for the styles of my web pages, and also I have been working with Bootstrap.  

JavaScript

I know the basics of this programming language, and I manage to use it in the Frontend of some of the web application that I have been creating.
